# Dart Toolkit

## Overview
**Dart Toolkit** is a collection of examples and demonstrations showcasing key features of the Dart programming language. This repository covers essential Dart utilities such as string manipulation, collections (lists, sets, maps), file handling, and date-time operations.

Each feature is implemented in individual Dart files, and the main program combines these utilities to create a small application that demonstrates practical use cases.

## Features

1. **String Manipulation**
    - Concatenation, interpolation, and substring extraction.
    - Case conversion (uppercase and lowercase).
    - String reversal and length calculation.

2. **Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps)**
    - Demonstrates how to add, remove, and iterate over items in collections.
    - Suitable use cases for each collection type.

3. **File Handling**
    - Reading from and writing to files.
    - Handling errors during file operations.

4. **Date and Time**
    - Using the `DateTime` class to format, parse, and manipulate dates.
    - Calculating the difference between two dates.

5. **Application Demo**
    - Combines all the utilities into a small program that:
      - Performs string manipulations on user input.
      - Stores results in collections.
      - Saves results to a file.
      - Logs the date and time when each entry is made.
